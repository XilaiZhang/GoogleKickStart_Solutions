Update 07/07/2023:
[All Google coding competitions have come to an end](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/05/celebrate-googles-coding-competitions.html) Very sad news indeed. Hope everyone still loves competitive coding and keeps on learning, practicing, and achieving!

My AC solutions that passes **\*\*ALL\*\*** test cases, with explanations. <br />
  **\*\*EVERY\*\*** problem before 2017_Round C and after 2017_round F. <br /><br />

1. Some problem analysis provides **unique** approaches that I haven't seen other people use    e.g. 2020 round d problem 4 <br />
3. Some problem analysis provides my approach that is easier to implement than, and equally as good as the official solution   e.g. 2021 round f problem 2 <br />
3. Some problem analysis (written by me) are the most detailed analysis on the internet (because no one writes about it :)    e.g. 2016 round e problem 4) <br />
4. Some problem analysis corrects mistakes made in official analysis. i.e., you would get **WRONG** answer if you follow the implementation of official analysis. See why the official analysis is wrong in e.g. 2022 Round H problem 4. (as of 11/15/2022) <br /><br />

I have re-named my variables and functions to be more verbose in my solutions to increase readability of codes. <br />
